# K-Means-Clustering
K-means clustering is about grouping similar data points together to discover underlying patterns. Itâ€™s like finding natural groupings in a crowd based on shared characteristics. This method partitions the data into K distinct clusters based on their features, with each group having a centroid that is the mean of the points within it.
